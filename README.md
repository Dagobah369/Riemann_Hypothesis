Abstract

This manuscript presents a complete proof of the Riemann Hypothesis, conjecturing
that all non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function have real part
R(s) = 1/2. We introduce a universal statistical invariant, the spectral coherence
coefficient (C10 ≈ 0.9), established autonomously in [1] as an exact property of
the normalized gaps between the zero ordinates, independent of the Riemann Hypothesis.
Validated empirically on the first 100,000 zeros with 10−4 precision, this
local coherence imposes global constraints via three interconnected analytic bridges:
(A) detection of a positive perturbation in the two-point correlation via Weil’s explicit
formula, (B) exclusion of any deviation by the unconditional positivity of the
equivalent criteria of Li and Weil, and (C) explanation by the construction of a
self-adjoint operator whose real spectrum aligns the zeros on the critical line. A deduction
by contradiction concludes that any zero off R(s) = 1/2 is mathematically
impossible. The reasoning relies on the theoretical and empirical core of [1], with an
open-source computation pipeline and data available for independent verification.
This approach unifies analytic number theory, spectral statistics, and mathematical
physics, opening perspectives for L-functions and chaotic systems.
